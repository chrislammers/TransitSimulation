# Transit Simulation

Simulation of a generic transit system.

## Architecture

The main data structure will be a directed graph representing stations (nodes) and their connections (edges). Most Connections will be two way due to the linear nature of transit systems.
I may even start with an undirected graph as a starting point.

## First Case

Two stations that our transit vehicle runs between back and forth
